Leveraging AI for Enhanced User Acquisition
SuperPlay, a studio brimming with mobile gaming expertise from industry giants like Playtika and Rovio, faced the typical challenge of expanding their user base for their innovative dice and domino-themed titles: Dice Dreams and Domino Dreams. Acquiring the right players, who are both highly engaged and primed to contribute meaningfully to the game's ecosystem, is a complex and often costly undertaking. This complexity is further amplified by the ever-changing preferences of modern mobile gamers. To navigate this demanding landscape, SuperPlay partnered with Gamelight, a platform powered by sophisticated AI algorithms designed to optimize user acquisition campaigns and deliver actionable insights. The core strategy behind the collaboration involved deploying AI-driven targeting to reach players with a higher propensity to become loyal, engaged users, driving revenue and ultimately impacting the availability of features like Domino Dreams Free Coins as valuable incentives within the game.
Analyzing User Data for Targeted Campaigns

Gamelight’s AI engine was fed a colossal dataset comprising two million user records across 11 key global territories, including the US, UK, France, Japan, Canada, Australia, and Italy. This rich data repository provided an unprecedented view into user behaviors, preferences, and gaming trends. The AI algorithms meticulously analyzed players’ in-game actions, purchase histories, device types, and a myriad of other data points. This holistic approach allowed SuperPlay to create laser-focused campaigns. By gaining deeper understanding of users, it was possible to better predict which players were most likely to be engaged and generate revenue, impacting the flow of features like Domino Dreams Free Coins that would be targeted within the game's ecosystem. Gamelight's AI-powered solution effectively dissected the vast amount of data within the platform to reveal patterns that helped shape SuperPlay's UA strategy.
Optimizing In-Game Events Through AI-Driven Insights

The partnership between SuperPlay and Gamelight saw the launch of a remarkable 38 in-game events. These events were strategically orchestrated and integrated seamlessly into the gameplay of Dice Dreams and Domino Dreams. SuperPlay leveraged the valuable AI-driven insights gleaned from Gamelight's data analysis to calibrate the timing and nature of these events to maximize engagement and generate revenue. This was a strategic move driven by Gamelight's data which identified ideal conditions for the release of fresh events. By capitalizing on insights about timing, user behavior, and player profiles, these events offered a more personalized experience. This customization was crucial in improving retention, reinforcing user engagement, and ultimately impacting how features like Domino Dreams Free Coins are delivered within the game to specific player types.
Real-Time Campaign Optimization and Continuous Learning

One of the key strengths of Gamelight’s platform is its ability to continuously refine advertising campaigns in real-time. The platform monitors performance across multiple KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and automatically adjusts bids and targeting parameters to improve ROI. This degree of real-time optimization ensures that ad spend is efficiently used to reach the most valuable users, leading to higher ROAS and improved user acquisition. SuperPlay was able to actively track the impact of the changes implemented by Gamelight. Further insights into the data provided the ability for the developers to refine their understanding of user behavior, including how players react to different aspects of the game’s economy - including opportunities to utilize Domino Dreams Free Coins for in-game advantages. The continuous learning cycle that Gamelight offers proved to be invaluable to SuperPlay, making campaign optimization a dynamic process rather than a static one.
Analyzing ROAS and ARPU: A Winning Formula

The results of the partnership between SuperPlay and Gamelight are truly impressive and demonstrate the positive impact of data-driven UA strategies. The focus on increased revenue and return on investment showcased the power of intelligent acquisition models. With a daily ad spend exceeding $500,000, the partnership yielded remarkable results that were tracked, analyzed, and continuously improved through the Gamelight platform.
100%+ ROAS and Growing ARPU

The most compelling result of the partnership is the return on ad spend (ROAS). SuperPlay achieved a ROAS exceeding 100% on mature user cohorts. This means that for every dollar spent on advertising, the company generated more than a dollar in revenue. This is a remarkable accomplishment, demonstrating the effectiveness of Gamelight's AI-powered optimization capabilities. In tandem, Dice Dreams’ ARPU (average revenue per user) saw a notable increase of 15%. This increase can be directly linked to the enhanced quality of the users acquired using Gamelight's AI-driven platform. It's a testament to the effectiveness of using sophisticated targeting and optimization to identify users with a higher lifetime value (LTV), a critical driver of revenue within the mobile gaming landscape - and a variable that influences the distribution of features like Domino Dreams Free Coins.
Climbing the Charts and Achieving Higher D30 ARPU

Another indicator of success is Dice Dreams’ remarkable rise in the US free games charts. The game climbed 48 positions thanks to the influx of high-quality users attracted through the Gamelight platform. By attracting new players using the intelligent prediction and acquisition capabilities of the AI, SuperPlay saw a significant improvement in the game's overall visibility and download rates. Furthermore, the D30 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) generated by Gamelight was observed to be 38% higher than other channels used by SuperPlay. This is a significant metric demonstrating the quality of engagement and revenue generated by users acquired through the Gamelight platform. As the ARPU metric increases, so too does the opportunity to increase the number of opportunities for users to receive features like Domino Dreams Free Coins within the gaming experience.
Optimizing Holiday Events for Maximum Impact

SuperPlay leveraged Gamelight's AI-driven capabilities to optimize events around major holiday periods. This coordinated effort resulted in a substantial 32% increase in revenue and a 24% rise in user activation. By integrating in-game events with the special rewards offered through Gamelight, SuperPlay was able to maximize the impact of these limited-time activities. The synchronization of these in-game events with the incentives provided by the platform ensured that players were strongly encouraged to engage with the events. These tactics were also able to influence participation and engagement with the ecosystem, increasing the likelihood that users will actively participate and engage with features like Domino Dreams Free Coins when they are made available within the game.
Ensuring User Quality and Preventing Fraud

In the competitive world of mobile gaming, fraud is a constant concern. SuperPlay understood this challenge and implemented a robust fraud prevention strategy through Gamelight's platform. This layered approach to fraud prevention played a crucial role in ensuring the authenticity of users acquired through the campaign. A crucial element of maintaining healthy growth is ensuring that players legitimately earned access to features within the game, including any opportunities to utilize Domino Dreams Free Coins to progress through the game's various challenges and rewards.
A Multi-Layered Fraud Prevention System

Gamelight employs a four-layer protection system to combat fraud. This comprehensive system includes Gamelight’s internal fraud prevention solution, Singular's Fraud Prevention Suite, and Scalar. These complementary solutions are then further reinforced by AppsFlyer’s Protect 360, providing a robust and multifaceted approach to identify and mitigate fraudulent activity. By layering these fraud prevention systems on top of their acquisition efforts, SuperPlay was able to ensure that only legitimate users were brought into the games ecosystem, ensuring they were acquiring genuinely interested players who are more likely to retain over time.
Maintaining User Trust and Protecting Brand Integrity

The collective impact of these security measures resulted in a remarkably low suspicion rate of less than 0.5% across all fraud categories. This impressive level of fraud protection showcases the efficacy of SuperPlay’s chosen strategy and the effectiveness of Gamelight's integrated solutions. This low suspicion rate, combined with the quality of users attained through the AI-driven platform, reinforced user trust and protected the integrity of both of SuperPlay’s gaming titles. By diligently protecting the experience of its loyal players, SuperPlay was able to maintain a strong brand identity and protect the legitimacy of in-game features, such as the value provided to users by Domino Dreams Free Coins when they are made available within the game.
Identifying and Addressing Potential Fraud Risks

By implementing a multi-layered approach to fraud prevention, SuperPlay was able to create confidence in the quality of users they acquired through Gamelight. This rigorous approach safeguards the games’ integrity and provides a healthy environment for new user acquisition. By effectively addressing fraud risks within the acquisition process, SuperPlay ensured user loyalty and the stability of the player base, reinforcing that Domino Dreams Free Coins are fairly awarded.
